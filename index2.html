        <p class="text">To my Ibtissam,<br>
            It all began with a simple act of tagging each other on random posts, and little did I know that it would bring such comfort and happiness into my life. <br>As we grew closer with each passing day, I couldn't help but notice your loveliness and attentiveness, and I knew I wanted to be your friend.<br> Over time, you have become an integral part of me, someone I cannot imagine my life without. In fact, you hold the position of my number one friend in my heart.<br> Your beauty, both inside and out, is unparalleled.<br> You possess a unique combination of being stunning, intelligent (well, maybe a little silly at times), adorable, caring, and kind-hearted. Every wonderful quality seems to find a home within you.<br> Today, you hold the title of my number one, and tomorrow, my love for you will only grow stronger.</p>

        <p class="text">From the very beginning, our friendship has been a journey filled with laughter, shared moments, and an unbreakable bond. I still remember the days when we used to tag each other in funny posts, and I couldn't help but smile every time I saw your name pop up on my notifications. You have this incredible ability to make me laugh, even when your jokes might not always hit the mark (though, let's be honest, you're hilarious more often than not).<br>

            But it's not just your sense of humor that has won me over. It's your kindness, your warmth, and the genuine love you've shown me throughout our friendship. Step by step, even when I didn't think I had room in my heart for anyone else, my feelings for you grew stronger.<br>
            You are my angel, the one who has brightened my darkest days and filled my life with joy. I cherish every moment we've spent together, and I can't imagine my life without you in it.<br>
            
            I know deep down that you feel the same way, and that's why I want to take our friendship to a whole new level. Tonight, under the stars, surrounded by the beauty of the world, I want to ask you something very important: Will you be mine? Will you be the one I think of all the mine, the one I share my dreams with, the one I love now and forever? <br>
            
            I want to create endless memories with you, share in your laughter and your tears, and build a story together that's as bright as our love. So, what about it? <p id="this" style="color: blue;">Will you be mine, not just for tonight, but for all the nights and days that follow?</p></p>

        <p class="text">From the very first time I stumbled upon your profile on Facebook, it felt like fate had woven its magic. Your cute and captivating posts caught my eye, and the simple act of tagging each other in those little moments of joy brought an inexplicable happiness to my days. It wasn't long before we started chatting in those DMs, and that's when everything changed.<br>

            You mean the world to me, and I wish I could find the words to truly express the depth of my feelings. You're not just my girlfriend; you're my everything. I yearn to hold your hand and wrap my arms around you for hours on end. My heart desires nothing but your presence, and I want nothing more than to stay by your side, forever if possible. I would go to the ends of the Earth and back for you.<br>
            
            Describing you is an absolute pleasure. Your beauty, both inside and out, leaves me in awe. You're undeniably stunning on the outside, and I often find myself marveling at the fact that you're mine. But your true radiance lies within your kind heart, so pure and white, always seeking the good for everyone. Your vibes create a world filled with shades of pink, populated by cute cats, rabbits, and blooming flowers. It's a world I long to explore, a place that feels like home and offers me the utmost comfort.<br>
            
            Your love, my dear, is homemade for me. Your smile belongs to me, and mine belongs to you. My love is yours entirely, every fiber of my being dedicated to you, and in return, all of you is mine. We are intertwined in a love that knows no bounds.<br>
            
            You are my friend, my soulmate, my lover - my everything. I can't fathom what life would be like without your radiant, positive energy enveloping me. It feels like a protective shield, granting me strength beyond measure.<br>
            
            As I look to the future, I can't help but dream of building a life together, holding you close, and sharing every joy and challenge life throws our way. I hope with all my heart that our love lasts until the end of time.<br>
            
            And now, my love, as this special day unfolds, I want to wish you the happiest of birthdays. May your future be as bright as your smile, filled with all the happiness and dreams your heart desires. Know that I'm here, loving you to infinity and beyond. Happy Birthday, my one and only.
